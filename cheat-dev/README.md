# cheat development notes

these are my personal notes for learning cheat development from scratch. i'm documenting everything as i learn - from basic computer concepts to advanced game hacking techniques.

## who is this for?

mainly me, but if you're also learning cheat dev and find these useful, feel free to use them. pull requests are welcome if you want to improve something or add missing info.

## learning path

the notes are organized in a specific order that builds on previous knowledge. **follow them sequentially** - don't jump ahead unless you already know the basics.

here's the structure:

1. **fundamentals** - how computers, memory, and processors work
2. **programming basics** - C++ fundamentals you need to know
3. **cheat engine** - hands-on practice with CE before coding
4. **reverse engineering** - understanding assembly and how to read it
5. **memory hacking** - reading/writing memory, pattern scanning
6. **C++ for game hacking** - applying C++ knowledge to actual cheats
7. **hooking techniques** - detours, vtables, and function hooks
8. **advanced techniques** - ESP, aimbots, and game engines
9. **anti-cheat** - how they work and basic bypass concepts

## writing style

these notes are written in a straightforward way:
- no unnecessary complications
- practical examples over theory
- code comments in lowercase (except variable names and proper nouns)
- human-readable, not AI-generated corporate speak type shit

## code examples

simple code snippets are inline in the markdown files. multi-file projects will go in `assets/code-examples/` when needed.

if you're reading this and learning too, good luck. game hacking is a rabbit hole but it's fun as hell - atleast for me
